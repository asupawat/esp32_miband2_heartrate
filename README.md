# XBEE <= ESP-32 <=> MiBAND2 PROJECT
* 1st of all, I **SINCERELY RECOMMAND** you to view / edit this program using Notepad++, Sublime Text or something else rather than Arduino IDE since my codes are **PROLICX** and **HARD TO READ** with **A MESS OF FORMAT ERRORS**, which would make **YOU EXPERTS CRAZY**.
* **AND I SINCERELY APOLOGIZE FOR MAKING YOU EXPERTS CONFUSED, AS WELL AS DISTURBING YOUR DINNER TIME :)**
* **TALK IS CHEAP, SHOW ME THE CODE**. If Mr.<del>Smart</del>Smug thinks that all the troubles I met can be avoided but I'm too stupid to solve them in 3 minutes (maybe so), please inherit my work as soon as possible, at least contribute your scheme (by code) and I am happy to merge it into the project. If you can't or unwilling to do so, just complain unceasingly or laugh like an idiot, **SOOO OOO OOOO OP, GO OOO OOOO OOOOOOOF :)**
* Words above do not aim at any specific people, my friends. I'm a patient with persecutory delusion. All these situations are my illusions and will never happen in our real life :)
