# XBEE <= ESP-32 <=> MiBAND2 PROJECT
* 1st of all, I **SINCERELY RECOMMAND** you to view / edit this program using Notepad++, Sublime Text or something else rather than Arduino IDE since my codes are **PROLICX** and **HARD TO READ** with **A MESS OF FORMAT ERRORS**, which would make **YOU EXPERTS CRAZY**.
* **AND I SINCERELY APOLOGIZE FOR MAKING YOU EXPERTS CONFUSED :)**
